The Theater conclusions regarding the launch date is that people didn’t want to go to the theater  after June, while march, April and May were beyond successful during those months. 
Maybe the Theater was done outside, so therefore in the colder months people didn’t want to go. 
Maybe people saw their account during tax time in April and their CPA told them to spend more more on charities, so they enjoy themselves and get a better right off?
